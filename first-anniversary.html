        <h1>The Moment My Future Changed</h1>
        <p>There are moments that shape us, and then there are moments that redefine everything. The night I met you, words flowed between us like a story already written in the stars. And when I first heard your voice, it was as if the universe itself paused to listen. "Hi Khaled, this is my voice," you said—and in that instant, I knew. I knew my life had found its missing piece.</p>
        <p>That night of endless conversation, that voice that turned words into melodies—they weren’t just fleeting moments. They were the foundations of a life I wanted to build, a future I wanted to shape, a love story that only had one ending—me, standing at the altar, waiting for you.</p>
        <p>Meeting you was fate. Hearing you was magic. Loving you is the path I choose, every single day, until the day I call you my wife.</p>
