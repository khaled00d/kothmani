        <h1>September 13th: The Night That Changed Everything</h1>
        <p>Some dates slip through life unnoticed, but the 13th of September carved itself into my soul. That night, a simple conversation on Facebook became the beginning of something I never saw coming. We talked as if we'd known each other for lifetimes, as if our souls had met long before our bodies ever did.</p>
        <p>Hour after hour, words poured out effortlessly, laughter filling the spaces between them. I fell in love with the way you saw the world, with the music that shaped your heart, with the humor that made even silence feel like home. And then, you told me about Najat—your little duck, a secret piece of your world that no one else knew about. It was then that I realized: I wasn’t just talking to someone special. I was talking to <em>you</em>.</p>
        <p>That night, I lost sleep but found something far greater—<strong>you</strong>. And from that moment on, nothing was ever the same.</p>
