        <h1>The First Time I Heard Your Voice</h1>
        <p>Some moments are fleeting, but then there are those that change everything. The first time I heard your voice, the world paused. And when you said, "Hi Khaled, this is my voice," I lost my breath. It was as if every note in your tone carried a story waiting to be written.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t just a voice; it was poetry, music, and warmth wrapped into a single sound. It filled the spaces in my soul I never knew were empty. In that instant, I knew—I wanted to write books about you, about the way your voice turned words into magic and moments into eternity.</p>
        <p>That day, I fell in love not just with a person, but with the melody of your existence. And from that moment on, nothing was ever the same.</p>
